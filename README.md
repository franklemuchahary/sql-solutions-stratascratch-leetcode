# Solutions for `SQL Problems` on StrataScratch and LeetCode 

[Strata Scratch](https://www.stratascratch.com/) and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) are interview platforms that have tons of programming interview questions from top tech companies. They are both great platforms for practicing general programming problems, data science specific programming problems, and also non-programming questions. I use it primarily for solving SQL problems. It is a great resource for practicing SQL because the questions are interesting and very similar to what these companies would be actually solving on a day-to-day basis. They do not seem like questions that were created just for interview purposes.

In this repository, I will be uploading **my solutions for various "Tricky" SQL problems** on **StrataScratch**, **LeetCode**, and **InterviewQuery** most of which are tagged as *Hard or Medium* on the difficulty scale. I will be using **PostgreSQL for problems from StrataScratch** and **MySQL for problems from LeetCode**. The actual link to the questions will be present as a comment in each of the SQL files.
