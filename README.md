# Solutions for Strata Scratch *Hard SQL Problems*

[Strata Scratch](https://www.stratascratch.com/) is a data science interview platform that has tons of interview questions from top tech companies. It is a great platform for practicing data science specific programming questions and non-programming questions. I use it primarily for solving SQL problems. It is a great resource for practicing SQL because the questions are interesting and very similar to what these comapnies would be actually solving on a day-to-day basis. They do not seem like questions that were created just for interview purposes.

In this repository, I will be uploading my solutions for various SQL problems on Strata Scratch that are tagged as *Hard* on the difficulty scale. I will be using **PostgreSQL** for solving these questions. The actual link to the questions will be present as a comment in each of the SQL files.
